<h3>Resolvers</h3>

<div>
  <div>Resolver allows you to get data before navigating to the new route</div>
  <div>
    Sometimes you need some data ready before you navigate to certain route. This data may be
    from server. You can use resolver for this action.

    <ol>
      <li>Make a resolver. I made my resolver as resolver.component.resolver.ts
      Here I'm fetching some list data from server</li>
      <li>Configure the routes in resolver.module.ts.
       <span>`path: 'resolver', component: ResolverComponent, resolve: resolvedData: ResolverComponentResolver` this is the important part.
      So when navigating to /resolver resolver will be activated and whatever data you get from the resolver I can access it by the variable resolvedData
      </span>
      </li>
      <li>accessing resolvedData
        From resolverComponent, inject an activatedRoute in constructor.
        You can access the data by route.snapshot.data.resolvedData. Here resolvedData is the variable I set in the module.
      </li>
    </ol>
